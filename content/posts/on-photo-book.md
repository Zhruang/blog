Atmosphere of the photobook: its nature of infinitely resembling storytelling but never having the tools just enough to make itself coherent is a cursed blessing. It creates atmospheres. It is totally episodic, fissured, an open weave, impression after impression. Any attempt at static decoding in relation to one image is consistently disrupted by whatâ€™s before, after, and around. Montages, juxtapositions, portable and traveling exhibitions, Duchamp. In order to make a photo-book, the photographer has to be at the same time a full-fledged curator. The reader constantly refers to their own body so as to navigate page after page: finger skateboarding. It is a *beating-around-the-bushes*, not at all a bad approach to reality.
