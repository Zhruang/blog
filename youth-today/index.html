They say the masses today are paralyzed and manipulated, surrendered to the toxic allure of television, of social media, of tourism, of the spectacle that fragments the soul of people rather than making it whole. These intellectuals almost always come from an older generation, people in their 40s, sometimes in their 70s. Age seems to be the precondition of becoming an intellectual; no teenager is called a <em>thinker</em>, an <em>intellectual</em>, a <em>great critic of our time</em>. Unlike chess, painting, music, gymnastics, or even literature, the critical culture has no place for youth, because they lack perspective, lack a life in the olden days to compare contemporary life with. <em>Back 50 years ago, we were this or that. We read Lacan together in the empty classroom at night, and we fell in love with each other.</em> Contemporary life is presented to them indeed as a nightmare.</p><p>The motif of dream is important in two readings of history, one of revolution, and one of armageddon. In both, history is viewed as an inevitable progression of events leading to a fatality, either as the eventual realization of humanity, or as total destruction of humanity. After the total bankruptcy of global communism at the end of the 20th century, we were left with only the second one. What we find ourselves in is a nightmare incompatible with our body and torturing our mind, one we only wish to wake up from. The wish to wake up effectively is the wish to join the past in the future (which at this point could probably only be the next world), to make the past and future coherent and undo the damage done by the present. The present is the source of our sufferings, us from the past.</p><p>If people who lived the past have come to read the present as a foreign language which can only be learned and interpreted first from their first language, their past life as they believe. The youth to their eyes also represents an unfathomable people who effectively speaks this language of the present as their mother tongue. <em>It is only when one learns a second language that one knows more about their mother tongue</em>, they say. A perspective. An understanding inaccessible to monolinguals. Except something else also tends to escape these bilinguals: to experience the present as it is without translation, to accept this present as the basis of all possible discussions, and read the past like a new language.</p><p>This is the meaning of staying young, to treat the present time as one’s own, to put into question the past with help of the present, not vice versa. History is utterly useless if one treats the present as something one only needs to sleep through, just like historical communism has demonstrated to us about the future (<em>Comrades, sleep faster!</em>). It is in this youth that we learn that reading, traveling, loving, as imagined to have existed in the past, were only historically contingent and were bound up with contradictions belonging to an old order which excluded, discriminated, and move things around in ways that were different from those of the new order. Which is to say, to be absorbed in Plato for hours, to be crying in front of Van Gogh, to travel to a forgotten town with a pair of fresh eyes may be all well and good. But they are never inherently necessary (nor almost morally desirable), nor should they become grounds to invalidate the habits and desires of the lives that are lived today.</p></article></main></body></html>
