What is thought to be brought about by Duchamp’s ready-made, that is, that art was no longer understood as making but exhibiting, was nothing but the total colonization of human life by the institutions of art, through the gaze of art-making. The gaze under which religious, political, communal designs were turned into art objects, or at least, objects “of the museum”, once strictly associated with the interior space of the museum, has been diffused to literally every corner of the planet and now concerns not only objects but activities, events, people, spaces, that is, every form of existence or non-existence. Contemporary art is the purest and most naked expression of such logic.</p><p>In order to understand how such a development has been realized, we are forced to conceive artists themselves today as effectively a kind of autonomous institution of art in and of themselves. It is consistent with and entangled with other institutions who implicate in and contribute to the operation of the discourse of art: galleries, biennials, art schools, art magazines, etc. All these I should provisionally call the Museum with a capital M. Contemporary artists are its missionaries, taking advantage of their nomadic bodies across the globe (remember, one key characteristic of contemporary art can be said to be global in scope) to spread the power and influence of the Museum. What their mission entails, however, almost has nothing to do with their direct effect on material reality. They might do this or that, maybe something very concrete and wholesome like community-building in a neighborhood, but what defines their undertaking in this world, what at the end of the day defines them as artists, is the casting of that art-making gaze upon life, almost in a Medusa fashion, which bathes the world in the mercy of art, of the Museum. Thus, contemporary art now infinitely resembles Debord’s spectacle, while Duchamp appears more and more like a forerunner of global capitalism.</p><hr><p>我们或许可以斗胆说，杜尚在艺术史上造成的断裂是无论如何都会发生的，与个人的天才想法无关。所谓杜尚现成品带来的革命，即艺术不再被视为制作而是展示，不过是艺术机构通过「创造艺术的凝视」对人类生活的全面殖民。这种曾将宗教、政治、群落设计转化为艺术品或博物馆物件的凝视，曾经严格局限在博物馆内部空间，如今已扩散至地球的每一个角落。它现在也不仅涉及物品，还涵盖活动、事件、人、空间，一切存在或非存在。当代艺术正是这种逻辑最纯粹、最赤裸的表达。</p><p>要理解这一发展过程，我们必须将当代艺术家视为一个自成一体的艺术机构，与其他参与并促进艺术话语运作的机构行动一致且相互纠缠：画廊、双年展、艺术学院、艺术杂志等。所有这些我暂且称之为大写的博物馆。当代艺术家是它的传教士，利用ta们在全球游走的身体（记住，当代艺术的一个关键特征可以说就是它的全球性）传播大写的博物馆的力量和影响。然而，ta们的使命几乎与其对物质现实的直接影响无关。ta们可能做这做那，也许是一些非常具体且有益的事情，比如邻里社区建设。ta们可能旗帜鲜明地反对小写的博物馆。但定义他们在这个世界上的工作，最终定义ta们为艺术家的，是将那「创造艺术的凝视」几乎以美杜莎的方式投向生活，使世界沐浴在艺术的，大写的博物馆的怜悯中。如此，当代艺术无限接近于德波的资本景观，而杜尚，更像是全球资本主义的先行者。</p></article></main></body></html>
