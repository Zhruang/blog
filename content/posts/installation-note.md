- 2 vinyl signages
	- name
	- work

- **Installation of your work**
	- know the space you are working with
	- **make a diagram** → a must
		1. note the width of the whole area at the bottom
		2. draw out all the works on paper and indicate the sizes of them
		3. mark works with letters (A, B, C, etc.)
		4. do all the maths, figure out the spacing
	- **the ideal height of work**
		5. the center of the work is 60 in. from the floor
		6. do all the maths, figure out where the nails/screws go (roughly, it’s going to be determined by the specific frame)
	- **framing / mounting**
		7. know about your frame
		8. better have the prints professionally mounted
		9. glass / acrylic, blahblahblah (don’t buy cheap acrylic, look for UV acrylic)
		10. alternative to regular frames → **facemounting & cleat**
		11. resources to check out: whitewall.com / americanframe.com / metropolitan picture framing / G & L mounting / canal plastics
		12. two-screw mounting is the best option, ideally the two are at least 12 in. apart
