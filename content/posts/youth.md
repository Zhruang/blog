title: Youth today

Time and time again, there pop out this or that intellectual who grieves the death of reading, of traveling, of deep attention, of genuine social bonds, and so forth. They say the masses today are paralyzed and manipulated, surrendered to the toxic allure of television, of social media, of tourism. These intellectuals almost always come from an older generation, people in their 40s, sometimes in their 70s. Age seems to be the precondition of becoming an intellectual; no teenager is called a *thinker*, an *intellectual*, a *great critic of our time*. Unlike chess, painting, music, gymnastics, or even literature, the critical culture has no place for youth, because they lack perspective, lack a life in the olden days to compare contemporary life with. *Back 50 years ago, we were this or that. We read Lacan together in the empty classroom at night, and we fell in love with each other.* Contemporary life is presented to them indeed as a nightmare.

The motif of dream is important in two readings of history, one of revolution, and one of armageddon. In both, history is viewed as an inevitable progression of events leading to a fatality, either as the eventual realization of humanity, or as total destruction of humanity. After the total bankruptcy of global communism at the end of the 20th century, we were left with only the second one. What we find ourselves in is a nightmare incompatible with our body and torturing our mind, one we only wish to wake up from. The wish to wake up effectively is the wish to join the past in the future (which at this point could probably only be the next world), to make the past and future coherent and undo the damage done by the present. The present is the source of our sufferings, us from the past.

If people who lived the past have come to read the present as a foreign language which can only be learned and interpreted first from their first language, their past life as they believe. The youth to their eyes also represents an unfathomable people who effectively speaks this language of the present as their mother tongue. *It is only when one learns a second language that one knows more about their mother tongue*, they say. A perspective. An understanding inaccessible to monolinguals. Except something else also tends to escape these bilinguals: to experience the present as it is without translation, to accept this present as the basis of all possible discussions, and read the past like a new language.

This is the meaning of staying young, to treat the present time as one’s own, to put into question the past with help of the present, not vice versa. History is utterly useless if one treats the present as something one only needs to sleep through, just like historical communism has demonstrated to us the same about the future (*Comrades, sleep faster!*). It is in this youth that we learn that reading, traveling, loving, as imagined to have existed in the past, were only historically contingent and were bound up with contradictions belonging to an old order which excluded, discriminated, and move things around in ways that were different from those of the new order. Which is to say, to be absorbed in Plato for hours, to be crying in front of Van Gogh, to travel to a forgotten town with a pair of fresh eyes may be all well and good. But they are never inherently necessary (nor almost morally desirable), nor should they become grounds to invalidate the habits and desires of the lives that are lived today.

一而再、再而三地，总有这样或那样的知识分子冒出来哀叹阅读、旅行、专注、真诚关系的消亡。他们说，当下的大众被麻痹操控，沉溺于电视、社交媒体、旅游的毒性诱惑中。这些知识分子几乎总是老一辈，四十岁，有时七十岁。年纪似乎是成为知识分子的前提；没有哪个青少年会被称作思想家、知识分子，或「我们这个时代的伟大批评家」。和象棋、绘画、音乐、体操，甚至文学不同，批评文化中没有青年的位置，他们缺乏视角，缺乏「过去的生活」来与当下作比较。「五十年前，我们是这样或那样的。我们晚上在空荡的教室里读拉康，彼此相爱。」在他们眼中，当代生活是一场噩梦。

梦的意象在两种对历史的解读中很重要：革命的，末日的。在两种叙述中，历史被看作一串不可避免的事件演进，通向某种宿命，不是人类的最终实现，就是人类的彻底毁灭。随着二十世纪末全球康米主义的破产，我们只剩下了后一种版本。我们所处的现实是一场噩梦，与我们的身体格格不入，折磨我们的心灵，我们只想从中醒来。而这种醒来的愿望，事实上是希望在未来中重新加入过去（这未来在此刻也许只能被认为是来世），希望让过去与未来连贯起来，以此抹除当下造成的伤害。当下是我们，来自过去的人的痛苦之源。

那些活在过去的人，会把当下看作一门外语，只有通过自己所熟悉的母语⸺他们自认为的过去生活⸺才能学习、理解。在他们眼里，青春代表着一群深不可测的，当下的母语使用者。「只有学习第二语言，人们才会更了解自己的母语」，他们说。一种视角。一种单语者无法获得的理解。然而，另一种东西又会在这些双语者身上缺失：不经翻译地体验当下，接受当下本身为一切讨论的出发点，并把过去读作一门新语言。

这正是「保持年轻」的意思：正视当下为自己的时间，以当下为工具来质疑过去，而不是反过来。如果一个人只是把当下作为一段只需睡过去的时间，那历史就毫无意义，正如历史上的康米主义对未来做出了相同的证明（同志们，睡快点！）。正是在这青春中，我们才会明白，那些被想象为存在于过去的阅读、旅行与爱情，其实只是历史上的偶然产物，它们与一个旧有秩序中的矛盾紧密相连⸺那个秩序以不同于新秩序的方式排斥、歧视、运转着世界。也就是说，沉浸在柏拉图中数个小时、在梵高的画前落泪、带着崭新眼光旅行到一座被遗忘的小镇，这些或许都很好，但它们从来都不是本质上的必要（更不是道德理想），也不应成为用来否定当代生活中各种习惯与欲望的理由。
